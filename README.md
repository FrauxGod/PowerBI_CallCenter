1. Introduction <br />
The Call Center Analytics Dashboard provides detailed insights into call center operations, performance metrics,
customer interactions, and agent efficiency. It empowers stakeholders to monitor KPIs, identify operational bottlenecks,
and make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and resource allocation.

3. Objectives <br />
-Track call volumes and call handling times. <br />
-Analyze call reasons and customer sentiment. <br />
-Evaluate performance across different call centers and communication channels. <br />
-Identify areas for operational improvements and faster response times. <br />


4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <br />
-Total Calls: Total number of calls received over a specific time period. <br />
-Total Call Duration (Hours): Cumulative call duration in hours for resource planning. <br />
-Total Call Duration (Minutes): Total call time in minutes for granular insights. <br />
-Average Call Duration (Minutes): Average time spent per call to assess agent efficiency. <br />
-Response Time Percentage: Percentage of calls answered within the predefined time frame, reflecting service quality. <br />
 

5. Visualizations (Charts): <br />
-Total Calls by Day: Bar chart displaying call volume trends across weekdays. <br />
-Total Calls by State: Map visualization showing call distribution geographically across states. <br />
-Top Reasons for Calls: Treemap showcasing major reasons for customer calls. <br />
-Total Calls by Channel: Donut chart visualizing call volume across communication channels (Call Center, Chatbot, Email, Web). <br />
-Total Calls by Sentiment: Bar chart classifying customer sentiment into Negative, Neutral, Positive, etc. <br />
-Total Calls by Call Center: Horizontal bar chart highlighting call center-wise call volumes (Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver). <br />


6. Filters: <br />
-Date Range: Filter the dashboard based on selected date intervals. <br />
-Channel: Filter data by communication channel (Call Center, Chatbot, Email, Web). <br />
-City: Filter data by call center locations. <br />


7. Non-Functional Requirements: <br />
-Performance: Dashboard designed to load within 5 seconds for datasets up to 50,000 records. <br />
-Usability: Clean, intuitive layout ensuring easy navigation for all users. <br />
-Scalability: Architecture supports scaling up to 1 million call records without significant performance drops. <br />
